Win Condition Detection: The game detects when a player has won by getting three markers in a row, column, or diagonal, and displays the result.
Draw Detection: If all spots are filled without a winner, the game announces a draw.
Reset Functionality: Users can reset the game at any time to start a new round.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the game board and user interface.
